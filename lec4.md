### Uniform Charge DIsk

[pic 2]
Disk has charge uniformly distributed through the surface area.
Ring of charge
$\Rightarrow E = \frac{KQz}{(z^2+a^2)^{3/2}}$
Switch $a$ to $r$ since r changes thought the disk.
$\Rightarrow E = \frac{KQz}{(z^2+r^2)^{3/2}}$

Ring of charge with radius $r$.

```COnvert it diferential equation```
$dE = \frac{KdQ}{r^2}$
$E = \frac{KQ}{r^2}$

$dE = \frac{KdQz}{(z^2 + r^2)^{3/2}}$

$\Rightarrow dE = \frac{KdQz}{(z^2+r^2)^{3/2}}$

Areaa charge Density, $\sigma$
$\sigma = \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{dQ}{\pi r ^2} = (\frac{dQ}{dA})$ 
where A is area.

$\frac{dQ}{dr} = \sigma 2 \pi r$
$\Rightarrow dQ = \sigma 2 \pi r dr$

$dE = \frac{kz}{(z^2 + r^2)^{3/2}}\sigma 2 \pi r dr$
$dE =\frac{1}{4 \ pi \epsilon_0}\frac{z}{(z^2 + r^2)^{3/2}}\sigma 2 \pi r dr$
$dE =\frac{z \sigma r }{2\epsilon _0 (z^2 + r^2)^{3/2}}dr$

> we don't break it into different componets as we have already done it with ring

$E = \int _0^R{\frac{z \sigma r }{2\epsilon _0 (z^2 + r^2)^{3/2}}dr}$
$E = \frac{z \sigma}{2\epsilon_0}$

Electric Field due to a charged disk at point p some distance z away from the center of the disk.
> On exxam wil be one eletric field problem MINIMUM

### A Large Thin Sheet
What if you take the charged disk and make z << R.
What is E?

$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}(1-\frac{z}{(z^2 + R^2)^{1/2}})$
$\Rightarrow E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}$
Thin Large Sheet of Charge

### Two Paralel Plates (Non-Conduting)

Assume there are two large thin sheets that are paralel and non-conducting separated by a distance d.

Further assume that one plate has a chage densityof $-\sigma$ and the other $+\sigma$.

[pic 4]

What is the E field at each point p?

The electric field can only be found in between two large thin sheets of charge but not outside the range.

## 6 Motion of charged particles in Exxternal Eletrci Field
We will assume some unknown source is producing a **known** eletric field.
### + Single Particle in an External E field

[pic 5]

Test charge pushed away from the source.

>Q: is the E field positive?
>A: thats the bueaty of the being given extenral feild that we don't need to know the sources

q > 0 follow the $\vec{E}_{ext}$
q < 0 oppositve the $\vec{E}_{ext}$

Electric field -> force -> acceleration -> velocity of particle
Force on the charge particle due to $\vec{E}_{ext}$: $$\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$$

Map $\vec{E}$ with a test charge $q_0$: $\vec{F} = q_0\vec{E}$

> Dont mix them up!

#### Example
An ink drop of mass $m = 1.3 * 10^{-10}kg$ has a negative charge of charge magnitude $Q = 1.5 * 10^{-13} C$ enters a region between two paralel plates (non-conducting). It travels (initially) in +x direction with velocity  $v_x = 18 m/s$

The plates create an External $\vec{E}$ field that deflects the path of the drop from its x direction.

By how much in the y direction is it deflected by the time it exits teh space between the plates?

Assume the plates are a length $L = 1.6 cm$ and the $E_{EXT} = 1.4 \times 10^6 N/C$ and the plates are arranged such that $\vec{E}_{EXT}$ points downwar.
